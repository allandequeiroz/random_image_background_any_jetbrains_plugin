Give some personal touch to your IDE with background images randomly picked from a directory of your choice.

The usage is quite straight forward, set two parameters, tweak the third one, and you're ready to go.

## Overview

Let's start with a quick explanation about each of the fields
* Image folder: The folder containing the images to be used as background.
* Time (seconds): The timeframe that each image will remain visible before being replaced by the next one.
* Opacity: The IDE opacity (transparency) over the background image. Darker to the left, lighter to the right.
* Disabled: If you want to disable the background change features without uninstalling the plugin, disable it. If you change your mind, enable it again.
