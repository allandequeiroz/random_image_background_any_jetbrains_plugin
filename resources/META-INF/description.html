Give some personal touch to your IDE with background images randomly picked from a directory of your choice.
<br/>
<br/>
The usage is quite straight forward, set two parameters, tweak the third one, and you're ready to go. <br/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Let's start with a quick explanation about each of the fields
<ul>
    <li><b>Image folder</b>: The folder containing the images to be used as background.</li>
    <li><b>Time (seconds)</b>: The timeframe that each image will remain visible before being replaced by the next one.
    </li>
    <li><b>Opacity</b>: The IDE opacity (transparency) over the background image. Darker to the left, lighter to the
        right.
    </li>
    <li><b>Disabled</b>:
        If you want to disable the background change features without uninstalling the plugin, disable it. If you change
        your mind, enable it again.
    </li>
</ul>
